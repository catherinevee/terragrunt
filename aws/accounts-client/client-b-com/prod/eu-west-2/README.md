   - Ensure modules are deployed in the correct order
   - Verify all dependencies are properly configured

2. **Security Group Issues**
   - Check that security group rules allow required traffic
   - Verify VPC endpoints are accessible from private subnets

3. **RDS Connection Issues**
   - Ensure database subnet group is properly configured
   - Verify security groups allow database access
   - Check Performance Insights and monitoring configuration

4. **ALB Health Check Failures**
   - Check target group health check configuration
   - Verify application is responding on the health check path
   - Ensure deletion protection is not blocking operations

5. **KMS Key Issues**
   - Verify KMS key permissions and policies
   - Check key deletion windows (30 days for production)
   - Ensure proper key rotation is configured

### **Monitoring & Alerts**
